# NBSmqtt, the mqtt client from NBSgames.AT
## Sounds cool but isn't, really.
Well, the thing is.  We have a start at least.

## Infos.
First, you need to download [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and then you can git pull that thing as install all the deps that are needed by using `npm install`. 

## Libraryies used:

* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/): Framework to use Websites as normal applications for Mac, Linux and Windows
* [mqtt.js](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js): THe MQTT Library
* [async mqtt](https://github.com/mqttjs/async-mqtt): Turns Mqtt.JS into something of an async thing.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): Makes it easier to build the application.
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap4 for the user interface.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): jQuery is old, I know, but makes things easier.
* [jQuery color](https://code.jquery.com/color/): I need color animation, I think.
* [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/): No need for it but a dependency of bootstrap anyway.

## Screenshots:
As long as I don't have any screenshots I won't be able to share anythings related to usage to the application.
